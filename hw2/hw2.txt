Problem 1
(a) : Unmodified
(b) : Untracked for fun_problem.txt and modified for README.md
(c) : Staged for both
(d) : Modified for both
(e) : Staged for README.md and Unmodified for fun_problem.txt.
		Now the content of fun_problem.txt is empty because of
		git checkout --filename which removes all previous changes
(f) : Modified because you add a line into README.md, 
		thus modifying the file.

Problem 3
1. A list of integers from 1 to 100, since each item has a unique number,
we will be able to access the item by if we know the index of it.

2. A set of the names of the movies in the Star Wars Universe,
since all movies in the Star Wars Universe are distinct, the key
can be the name of each movie.

3. A map of ISBNs as the keys and book names as the values,
since all books' ISBNs are distinct, we can use the ISBNs as the keys
and get the book names from the ISBNs.

4. A map of years as the keys and arrays of movie names as the values.
Since each year is a distinct number, it can be used as a key and
the we can get the array of movies released in the year with the key.

5. A map of strings that contain the season and the episode number as the keys
and the episode names as the values.
Since the season and the episode number are distinct, the two can be combined
and act as a key, and we can use the key to get the name of the episode.

Problem 4
A linked list 5,4,3,2,1 is returned. When funcA is called with input linked list
of 1,2,3,4,5, the r pointer points to 5 after the while loop and when funcB
is recursively called it reverses the list. After all funcB recursions, the l
pointer is pointing at 1, which is the end and l->next = nullptr sets the next
pointer of 1 to NULL. Then, when we return the pointer r at the end, we
return the completely reversed linked list of the input.
