Problem 1
Part (a) : 1,4,
Part (b) : 4,2,3
Part (c) : 2,3,4,5
Part (d) : 2
Part (e) : 2,3,4,5

Problem 2
Part (a) : 2
Part (b) : 1,2
Part (c) :  (1) - git add hw1q2b.cpp
			(2) - git log -p -3
Part (d) : GIt will commit the staged three files 
and make them part of repository history.
Part (e) : git clone git@github.com:gangsank/cs104.git

As the recursion goes, the min value becomes equal 
to the max value from 0 to 4 in each recursion, 
so it will print out all values in the arry, one per line.

2. when min value is bigger than max value, funcB will 
fail to terminate. For input values when min is smaller 
than max, funcB will always terminate because as the recursion 
keeps going on, the min becomes equal to the max value.

3. funcB(a, min, max) outputs all the values of array a from 
index min to index max.
