For problem 1, the templated functions of intersection and union 
are in the file called setutility.h

For problem 2, using configuration file is implemented within the
main function of crawler.cpp and search.cpp

The way how I read in the configuration file in the two problems
are different because the files will have different parameters.
For example, for cralwer, the configuration file not have a parameter
for query, probability, and steps whereas for pagerank, it will.

For problem 3, to compile cralwer, type make crawler

For problem 4, a function called candidates within search.cpp file does it.

For problem 5, to compile, type make search
